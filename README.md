# WHACK-A-MOLE
## Description:
This is a project totaly built with HTML and CSS.

Is a project guided by a [Platzi course](https://platzi.com/cursos/animaciones-css/), where i learned about some CSS animation concepts so i was able to build this

The project is inspired in the classic game "Whack - A - Mole", it has a iPhone look and all is designed inside the CSS, there's no sprites or template imports
